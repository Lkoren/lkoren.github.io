formatting issues with jekyll/markdown:

- putting div>img inside a paragraph tag drops the p tag from the second half of the text:

	Baylor College of Medicine is a medical school with teaching hospitals in Huston, Texas. They're in the process of commissioning a new building. <div class = "image">![Baylor College of Medicine, Special Care Building](/assets/2013-10-05/BCM)</div> <p>Aesthetec won the contract for a series of LED signage display panels. The panels are high-resolution LED elements [well, *higher* resolution than your average commodity red/green LED matrix. Picture elements are about 1mm in size. They're sold in small blocks that are 32 x 32 LED elements in size. Aesthetec's custom assembly is an array of 1 x 10 block (giving 320 x 32 pixels per row) mounted onto custom electronics and mounting hardware. This give you a nice sturdy modular LED strip with a small depth footprint. For Baylor these LED strips are then mounted into a frame behind Alabaster or wood veneer, allowing the light to diffuse through.]</p>

<p> is needed after </div> to fix issue.

- lists aren't being wrapped in <P> tags. Manually adding <P> means <UL><LI>...</LI></UL> isn't generated.

css: what does ^= and *= do?
