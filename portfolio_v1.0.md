##Portfolio v1.5

Inspired by an idea mentioned by [Kimberly Blessing](http://kimberlyblessing.com/) on an episode of [The Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/episodes/085-with-kimberly-blessing/), I'm in the process of writing a couple of mini white-papers on a few of my projects.

The first is about a [custom full-stack solution](/2013/10/05/Aesthetec-BCM.html) I did for [Aesthetec Studio](http://www.aesthetec.net). It's about 70%, 80% done.

You can also check out my [N-Body Simulator](http://www.liavkoren.com/nBody_main.html), which was recently awarded 'Best Simulation' in a Udacity [Interactive 3D Graphics](http://blog.udacity.com/2013/08/interactive-3d-graphics-class-second.html) competition. It depends heavily on WebGL, so your browser will need to be able to access a Graphics Unit for it to run. (It also tends to perform best in Chrome, because that's the sort of thing Google has poured a lot of money into.)

The previous version of my portfolio which showcases my design work lives at [www.liavkoren.com](http://www.liavkoren.org/portfolio_n.html).
